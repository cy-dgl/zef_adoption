Codebook for VM Fatigue and Adoption Study
All response options of all measures are 5 Likert-type scales ranging from 1, “Not at all” to 5 “Extremely,” unless we present a different option. Participants were asked to answer the most commonly used VM platform they use at the beginning of the survey among the possible response options ranging from Zoom, Google Meets, Gather.town, Facetime, etc. Once they answer this question, their response (e.g., Zoom) was tailored to ask the following questions. The questions for each measure included the phrase ‘the VM platform you primarily use,’ which was replaced by each participant’s response (e.g., Zoom or Gather.town).
